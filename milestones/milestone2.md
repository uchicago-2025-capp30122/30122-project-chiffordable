## Abstract :page_with_curl:

The city of Chicago has identified “an affordable housing gap of around 120,000 homes and 240,000 rental units”[^1], 42% of its residents are burdened by housing costs that exceed 30% of their income and “22% pay more than half of their income”. 

This project seeks to identify neighborhoods where low-income families can afford rental housing within a specified income and a percentage of their income they want/can spend on rent. Leveraging data analysis and geospatial mapping, it will also explore these neighborhoods' demographic, economic, and social characteristics, along with public service availability. The findings aim to provide actionable insights for policymakers and community stakeholders, offering a comprehensive resource for addressing Chicago's affordable housing crisis.

### Data Reconciliation Plan

We identified 4 different data sources that will be merged using geolocation data and/or community location indicators, such as Zip code and Community ID. The following figure represents the merging plan and variables that will allow us to create a centralized database for the project.
