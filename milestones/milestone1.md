## Abstract

100-200 words explaining the general idea for your project.  Be sure to read the project requirements and consider how you'll incorporate the various components.  These details can change as much as needed over the next few weeks, but we want to take a look at what's being considered.

## Preliminary Data Sources

### Data Source #1: USA Census to get the average income by zipcode
- A URL to the data source.
- From a webpage
- Cleaning of the large data sets

### Data Source #2: City of chicago 
- A URL to the data source.

## Preliminary Project Plan

A short summary of what components of the project might be needed (e.g. data ingestion, cleaning/preparation, visualization).

You might also begin to think about who will work on what.
This can be very brief, and will almost certainly change by the next milestone.

## Questions

A **numbered** list of questions for us to respond to.
